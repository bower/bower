- Offline usage
- Config
   - Allow `config.cwd` to be changed by an argument when using the CLI. Two ways of doing this:
      - Read a --cwd or similar and change the `config.cwd` to it
      - Allow any arbitrary `config.*` to be changed with --config.* arguments
         - It seems that `rc` already does this, but is bugged.. see: https://github.com/dominictarr/rc/issues/9
    - Codebase should access config directly and not use cached vars, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/232#issuecomment-16014467
- Registry
    - Register model
        - Allow endpoints other than git?
        - Allow easy unregister
        - Possible ways to get rid of shim repos

          - But then.. how would versions be handled here?? different versions might have changed the deps
    - Publish model
- Commands
    - Abbreviations is supported in nopt.. don't need to install anything else
    - Bower script x
         - post-install (only useful for moving files around)
         - pre-publish
         - etc
    - bower test
    - bower install & update
        - Ability to target specific commits and not only versions
            - But then, how would a version be guessed from it?!
            - It would be ok project wise, but if used within a reusable package, it must have a version!
        - Option to install deps in a tree structure like npm? see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/157
        - Be smart when guessing the name out of the endpoint, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/192
        - Allow a name to be specified when installing some endpoints, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/192#issuecomment-16014201
            - Also try to `guess` version from the file contents? see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/193
        - Print a tree like npm with the deps
        - Root packages that resolve to same higher versions should always have priority!!
        - Allow overrides of the registry for easier fork integration? this need to be discussed as part of the spec, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/342
        - Install only stable versions, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/266
        - Expand also .gz files, see: https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/347
- Contributing.md
  - Copy from master
  - Tell users to learn about promises
  - Tell users to not forget to call .done() to throw unhandled promise errors in tests
- Inter process locks? two processes running bower (either from the bin or programatically) might mess up the cache on write operations.. and possibly other write operations. Think about a solution for this (make the worker multi-process aware?!)
- Use update-notifier!!
- Use yeomen insight!!
- bower could setup a git hook on folders that are github repos to make validation of the json (if it conforms with the spec)
- in prod dont forget to Q.longStackJumpLimit = 0;
- switch from events to promise progress
  - wait for domenic response on twitter
  - progress events: name_change, warn (deprecated json, mismatch version..), action
