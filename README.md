# BOWER [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bower.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bower)

Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated
solution to the problem of **front-end package management**, while exposing the
package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated
build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared
between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made
up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS,
etc.).

## Installing Bower

Bower depends on [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). It's
installed globally using npm:

```
npm install -g bower
```


## Usage

Much more information is available via `bower help` once it's installed. This
is just enough to get you started.

### Installing packages and dependencies

Bower offers several ways to install packages:

```bash
# Using the dependencies listed in the current directory's bower.json
bower install
# Using a local or remote package
bower install <package>
# Using a specific Git-tagged version from a remote package
bower install <package>#<version>
```

Where `<package>` can be any one of the following:

* A name that maps to a package registered with Bower, e.g, `jquery`. ‡
* A remote Git endpoint, e.g., `git://github.com/someone/some-package.git`. Can be
  public or private. ‡
* A local Git endpoint, i.e., a folder that's a Git repository. ‡
* A shorthand endpoint, e.g., `someone/some-package` (defaults to GitHub). ‡
* A URL to a file, including `zip` and `tar.gz` files. It's contents will be
  extracted.

‡ These types of `<package>` make Git tags available. You can specify a
[semver](http://semver.org/) tag to fetch a specific release, and lock the
package to that version.

All package contents are installed in the `components` directory by default.
You should **never** directly modify the contents of this directory.

Using `bower list` will show all the packages that are installed locally.

**N.B.** If you aren't authoring a package that is intended to be consumed by
others (e.g., you're building a web app), you should always check installed
packages into source control.

### Finding packages

To search for packages registered with Bower:

```
bower search [<name>]
```

Using just `bower search` will list all packages in the registry.

### Using packages

The easiest approach is to use Bower statically, just reference the package's
installed components manually using a `script` tag:

```html
<script src="components/jquery/index.js"></script>
```

For more complex projects, you'll probably want to concatenate your scripts or
use a module loader. Bower is just a package manager, but there plenty of other
tools -- such as [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) and
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) -- that will help you do this.

### Registering packages

To register a new package, there **must** be a valid manifest JSON in the
current working directory, your package **must** be available at a Git endpoint
(e.g., GitHub), and it should use [semver](http://semver.org/) Git tags. Then
run:

```
bower register <my-package-name> <git-endpoint>
```

The Bower registry does not have authentication or user management. It's on a
first come, first served basis. Think of it like a URL shortener. Now anyone
can run `bower install <my-package-name>`, and get your library installed.

There is no direct way to unregister a package yet. For now, you can [request a
package be unregistered](https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/120).

### Uninstalling packages

To uninstall a locally installed package:

```
bower uninstall <package-name>
```


## Configuration

Bower can be configured using JSON in a `.bowerrc` file.

Global configuration is handled by creating a `.bowerrc` in your home directory
(i.e., `~/.bowerrc`).  Local configuration is handled by creating a `.bowerrc`
in your project's directory, allowing you to version a project-specific Bower
configuration with the rest of your code base.

Bower will combine the local and global configurations (with local settings
taking precedence).

The `.bowerrc` defines several options:

* `directory`: Set the default directory to install packaged components into.
* `endpoint`: Set a custom registry endpoint.
* `json`: Set the default JSON file for Bower to use when resolving dependencies.
* `searchpath`: An array of additional URLs pointing to read-only Bower registries.
* `shorthand_resolver`: Define a custom template for shorthand package names.

```json
{
  "directory": "bower_components",
  "endpoint": "https://bower.mycompany.com",
  "json": "bower.json",
  "searchpath": [
    "https://bower.herokuapp.com"
  ],
  "shorthand_resolver": "git://example.com/{{{ organization }}}/{{{ package }}}.git"
}
```

The `searchpath` array is useful if your organization wishes to maintain a
private registry of packages while also taking advantage of public Bower
registries. If a package is not found at your private endpoint, Bower will
consult the registries specified in the `searchpath` array.

The `shorthand_resolver` key provides support for defining a custom template
which Bower uses when constructing a URL for a given shorthand. For example, if
a shorthand of `twitter/flight` or `twitter/flight#v1.0.0` is specified in the
package manifest, the following data can be referenced from within the
`.bowerrc` as part of the `shorthand_resolver` template:

* `endpoint`: `twitter/flight`
* `organization`: `twitter`
* `package`: `flight`

**N.B.** To run your own Bower Endpoint for custom packages that are behind a
firewall, you can use a simple implementation of the [Bower
Server](https://github.com/twitter/bower-server).


## Defining a package

You must create a JSON file -- `bower.json` by default -- in your project's
root, and specify all of its dependencies. This is similar to Node's
`package.json`, or Ruby's `Gemfile`, and is useful for locking down a project's
dependencies.

You can interactively create a `bower.json` with the following command:

```
bower init
```

The `bower.json` defines several options:

* `name` (required): The name of your package.
* `version`: A semantic version number (see [semver](http://semver.org/)).
* `main` [string|array]: The primary endpoints of your package.
* `ignore` [array]: An array of paths not needed in production that you want
  Bower to ignore when installing your package.
* `dependencies` [hash]: Packages your package depends upon in production.
* `devDependencies` [hash]: Development dependencies.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "path/to/main.css",
  "ignore": [
    ".jshintrc",
    "**/*.txt"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "<name>": "<version>",
    "<name>": "<folder>",
    "<name>": "<package>"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "<test-framework-name>": "<version>"
  }
}
```


## Consuming a package

Bower also makes available a source mapping. This can be used by build tools to
easily consume Bower packages.

If you pass the `--map` option to Bower's `list` command, it will generate JSON
with dependency objects. Alternatively, you can pass the `--paths` option to
the `list` command to get a simple path-to-name mapping:

```json
{
  "backbone": "components/backbone/index.js",
  "jquery": "components/jquery/index.js",
  "underscore": "components/underscore/index.js"
}
```


## Programmatic API

Bower provides a powerful, programmatic API. All commands can be accessed
through the `bower.commands` object.

```js
var bower = require('bower');

bower.commands
  .install(paths, options)
  .on('end', function (data) {
    data && console.log(data);
  });

bower.commands
  .search('jquery', {})
  .on('packages', function(packages) {
    // `packages` is a list of packages returned by searching for 'jquery'
  });
```

Commands emit four types of events: `data`, `end`, `result`, and `error`.

`error` will only be emitted if something goes wrong. Not all commands emit all
events; for a detailed look, check out the code in `lib/commands`.

`data` is typically a colorized string, ready to show to an end user. `search`
and `lookup` emit `packages` and `package`, respectively. Those events contain
a JSON representation of the result of the command.

For a better of idea how this works, you may want to check out [our bin
file](https://github.com/twitter/bower/blob/master/bin/bower).

For the install command, there is an additional `package` event that is emitted
for each installed/uninstalled package.


## Completion (experimental)

Bower now has an experimental `completion` command that is based on, and works
similarly to the [npm completion](https://npmjs.org/doc/completion.html). It is
not available for Windows users.

This command will output a Bash / ZSH script to put into your `~/.bashrc`,
`~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file.

```
bower completion >> ~/.bash_profile
```


## A note for Windows users

To use Bower on Windows, you must install
[msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) correctly. Be sure to check the
option shown below:

![msysgit](http://f.cl.ly/items/2V2O3i1p3R2F1r2v0a12/mysgit.png)

Note that if you use TortoiseGit and if bower keeps asking your ssh password, you should add the following environment variable:
`GIT_SSH - C:\Program Files\TortoiseGit\bin\TortoisePlink.exe`
Adjust the `TortoisePlink` path if needed.
