Description:

    The link functionality allows developers to easily test their packages.
    Linking is a two-step process.

    Using 'bower link' in a project folder will create a global link.
    Then, in some other package, 'bower link <pkg>' will create a link in the components folder
    pointing to the previously created link.

    This allows to easily test a package because changes will be reflected immediately.
    Please note that bower will not fetch the linked package dependencies.

    Bower will overwrite the link when installing/updating.
